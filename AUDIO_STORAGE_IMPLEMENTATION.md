# 🎵 Audio Storage Implementation for Vibes + Music

## Overview
I've created a complete audio storage system that allows users to upload MP3 files and play them in the Vibes + Music card on the Lounge page. The system includes database storage, API endpoints, and a full-featured audio player.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created:
1. **`audio_tracks`** - Main table for storing audio file metadata
2. **`audio_playlists`** - User-created playlists
3. **`playlist_tracks`** - Junction table linking tracks to playlists
4. **`audio_likes`** - Track likes/favorites by users
5. **`audio_plays`** - Analytics data for play tracking

### Storage:
- **Supabase Storage Bucket**: `audio-files` for storing MP3 files
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- **File Organization**: Files stored under user folders (`{user_id}/filename.mp3`)

## 🔧 API Endpoints Created

### 1. `/api/audio/tracks` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **GET**: Fetch audio tracks with filtering options
  - `?featured=true` - Get featured tracks
  - `?trending=true` - Get trending tracks based on recent plays
  - `?genre=Electronic` - Filter by genre
  - `?limit=10&offset=0` - Pagination
- **POST**: Upload new track metadata
- **PUT**: Update existing tracks (user's own only)
- **DELETE**: Delete tracks (user's own only)

### 2. `/api/audio/upload` (POST)
- Handle audio file uploads to Supabase storage
- Process form data with metadata (title, artist, etc.)
- Validate file types (MP3, WAV, OGG, MP4)
- Generate unique filenames and store securely

### 3. `/api/audio/play` (POST, PUT)
- **POST**: Record play events for analytics
- **PUT**: Toggle like/unlike functionality
- Track play duration, completion rates, and user engagement

## 🎵 Audio Player Component

### Features:
- ✅ **Play/Pause Controls** with loading states
- ✅ **Track Navigation** (previous/next with shuffle/repeat)
- ✅ **Progress Bar** with seeking capability
- ✅ **Volume Control** with mute functionality
- ✅ **Like/Unlike Tracks** (authenticated users only)
- ✅ **Queue Display** showing upcoming tracks
- ✅ **Play Tracking** for analytics and recommendations
- ✅ **Error Handling** for failed audio loads
- ✅ **Responsive Design** matching your app's style

### Props:
```jsx
<AudioPlayer 
  tracks={audioTracks}              // Array of track objects
  currentTrackIndex={0}             // Current playing track index
  onTrackChange={handleTrackChange} // Callback for track changes
  showQueue={true}                  // Show/hide queue section
  className="custom-styles"         // Additional CSS classes
/>
```

## 🚀 How to Set Up

### 1. Run Database Setup
```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL editor
-- File: setup_audio_storage.sql
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
npm install formidable  # For file upload handling in the backend
```

### 3. Deploy Backend APIs
- Upload the API files to your Vercel/hosting platform
- Ensure environment variables are set:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

### 4. Frontend Integration
The AudioPlayer is already integrated into the Lounge page and will:
- Automatically fetch featured tracks from the database
- Display a loading state while fetching
- Show the audio player when tracks are available
- Display a "no tracks" message when the database is empty

## 📝 Sample Data Included

The setup script includes 3 sample tracks:
1. **"Love's Digital Dream"** by Suno AI (Featured)
2. **"Kampala Nights"** by Rising Star 
3. **"Diaspora Heart"** by Cultural Fusion

## 🔐 Security Features

### Storage Policies:
- ✅ Public read access to audio files
- ✅ Authenticated users can upload files
- ✅ Users can only modify their own files
- ✅ Files organized by user ID for security

### Database Policies:
- ✅ Public access to approved tracks only
- ✅ Users can manage their own uploads
- ✅ Moderation system (tracks require approval)
- ✅ Play tracking works for both authenticated and anonymous users

## 📊 Analytics & Features

### Play Tracking:
- Records play duration and completion rates
- Tracks user engagement for recommendations
- Supports both authenticated and anonymous users
- IP address and user agent logging for analytics

### Trending Algorithm:
- Combines recent plays (7-day window) with total plays and likes
- Updates in real-time based on user engagement
- Accessible via `/api/audio/tracks?trending=true`

### Like System:
- Users can like/unlike tracks
- Tracks display like counts
- Liked tracks are highlighted in the player
- Contributes to trending calculations

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Production:
1. **Add Audio Metadata Extraction**: Integrate `music-metadata` or `node-ffmpeg` for automatic duration/bitrate detection
2. **Implement Audio Processing**: Add compression/normalization for uploaded files
3. **Create Admin Panel**: For approving/rejecting uploaded tracks
4. **Add Playlists UI**: Frontend interface for creating and managing playlists
5. **Implement Search**: Search tracks by title, artist, or genre
6. **Add Recommendations**: Suggest tracks based on user listening history

### File Upload UI:
You can create an upload form that sends files to `/api/audio/upload`:
```jsx
<form encType="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="audio" accept="audio/*" />
  <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="Track Title" />
  <input type="text" name="artist_name" placeholder="Artist Name" />
  <input type="text" name="genre" placeholder="Genre" />
  <textarea name="description" placeholder="Description"></textarea>
  <input type="text" name="tags" placeholder="Tags (comma-separated)" />
</form>
```
